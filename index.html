                    Hi! My name's Matt and I like making things, especially on the web and mobile. I like to see projects through from beginning to end and my background experience in business and engineering helps me achieve that throughout the design process. I have experience in front-end web design and development, programming, iOS development, interaction design, and visual design. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My projects all seem to have a theme centered around building for people and bringing out the best in them. I make things for people because I care. I care about them because I care about their story. And I care about their story because their story is my story.

                    <!-- I care about their story because it's something, some theme we share -->

                    <!-- And because I care, those things I make better be designed as best as possible so people can have the best experience possible when using them. -->
                    <!-- Last summer, I worked on a <a href="http://oddlook.co"><u><b>startup</b></u></a> and did everything from ideation to development to design to marketing. The exposure to design I had during that time inspired me to go further in learning everything I could about it, from graphic design to interaction design to even the psychology behind the design of doors. I'm continually soaking up whatever I can get my hands on that's related to design and working on projects that interest me, which are shown below. Hope you enjoy! --><br> <br> <br>
                    Currently, I'm doing a 10-week internship at Kohl's Digital <br> doing front-end web development. Contact me at: <br> <strong>mattchiang777@gmail.com</strong>
