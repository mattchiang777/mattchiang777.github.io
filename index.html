			Yo,  my name is Matt and I like making things! I'm in my last semester at UC Berkeley looking for a product design position in the Bay Area. My background experiences in business and engineering helps me succeed cross-functionally. I have experience in front-end web development, programming, mobile development, interaction design, and visual design...but I"m always trying to get better.
